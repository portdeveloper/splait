## Development Rules

### Git Commit Guidelines
- Do not include AI assistant co-author attribution in commits
- Keep commit messages focused on the actual changes made
- Use conventional commit format when possible
- Commit atomically - each commit should represent a single logical change
- Commit every change - don't leave uncommitted work
